## Introduction

Social media influence analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Collect tweets from a user's timeline using the Twitter API.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected tweet data.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed tweets.
4. **Influence Measurement:** Calculate influence scores based on metrics like followers, retweets, and favorites.
5. **Network Analysis:** Build a user interaction network to identify central users.
6. **Visualization:** Visualize influence scores, sentiment distribution, and network metrics.
7. **Insights and Reporting:** Generate insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Features

- Collect tweets from a specified Twitter user's timeline using the Twitter API.
- Preprocess tweet text by removing special characters, URLs, and stopwords.
- Perform sentiment analysis on preprocessed tweets to determine sentiment polarity.
- Calculate influence scores based on followers, retweets, and favorites.
- Build a network graph of user interactions and calculate centrality metrics.
