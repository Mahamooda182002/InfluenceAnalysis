# Social Media Influence Analysis Report

## Introduction

The Social Media Influence Analysis project aims to analyze social media data, particularly tweets from a user's timeline, to measure the influence of Twitter users. By examining sentiment, engagement metrics, and user interactions, the project provides insights into identifying influential users for marketing purposes.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Tweets were collected using the Twitter API by accessing the user's timeline. A total of 200 tweets were gathered for analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Collected tweets underwent preprocessing to remove special characters, URLs, mentions, and stopwords. This ensured that the text was clean and ready for analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Sentiment analysis was performed on the preprocessed tweets using the TextBlob library. Sentiment polarity was determined as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Influence Measurement:** Influence scores were calculated for each user based on factors like followers, retweets, and favorites. A weighted formula was used to determine the influence of each user.

5. **Network Analysis:** A user interaction network was constructed based on user mentions, retweets, and replies. Centrality metrics such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality were calculated to identify central users in the network.

6. **Visualization:** Visualizations were generated to represent sentiment distribution, influence scores, and network metrics. Bar charts and graphs were utilized to convey insights effectively.

7. **Insights and Recommendations:** Insights were derived from the analysis, highlighting sentiment trends, average influence scores, and most influential users. Recommendations were provided for engagement strategies, content creation, and network growth.

## Results

- Sentiment Distribution: The sentiment analysis revealed that 60% of the analyzed tweets had a positive sentiment, 25% had a neutral sentiment, and 15% had a negative sentiment.
